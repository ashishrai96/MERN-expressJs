# MERN - ReactJS [Frontend Client]

- We have created the frontend side of the application using ReactJS.
- This frontend client contains 3 main components:
    - LoginForm
    - SignUpForm
    - Profile

- The structure of the code is based on the template provided by *create-react-app*.
- In this project, we have used functional components but you can use class components too if that suits your project.
- Most of the key concepts that are used in any React application are covered in this project.

### Steps to run the Client App.

- Open a new terminal and navigate to the location MERN-client/mern-client.
- Run the following command to install the dependencies :
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    This will create the node_modules folder and install all the packages in it.
-  Run the following command to start the application:
    ```
    npm start
